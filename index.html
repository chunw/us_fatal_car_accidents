            A road traffic crash results from a
            combination of factors related to the
            components of the system comprising roads, the
            environment, vehicles and road users, and the
            way they interact. Some factors contribute to the
            occurrence of a collision and are therefore part of
            crash causation. Other factors aggravate the
            effects of the collision and thus contribute to
            trauma severity. Some
            causes are immediate, but they may be
            underpinned by medium-term and long-term
            structural causes. Identifying the risk factors that
            contribute to road traffic crashes is important in
            identifying interventions that can reduce the risks associated with those factors.

                    One notable outlier from this map is <b> Loving, Texas</b>, a sparsely populated county with a soaring fatality rate of 3.158% (three fatal crashes in 2016).
                    The culprit is one West Texas Highway that is notorious for being dangerous -
                    Highway 285, which runs from New Mexico right on through the small town of Fort Stockton.

                    According to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, there were another three fatal crashes from the Texas state line to Loving in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourbasin.com/news/dangerous-drive-on-highway-285/862459415">2017</a>.

                  <div class="">
                    On the surface, it seems that the portion of fatal injuries are
                    higher in scenarios where the airbag is deployed than when it is not.
                    Keep in mind though, that frontal and side air bags
                    are generally designed to deploy in moderate to severe crashes
                    (may deploy in a minor crash). In fact, <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812494" target="_blank"> NHTSA estimated </a> that 2,756 lives were saved by frontal air bags in 2016.
                    This visualization is not to show that airbags are useless in terms of protecting vehicle occupants safety, as it can be
                    assumed that the crash severity level
                    on average is higher when airbags are deployed than when they are not.

                    Rather, a fair conclusion is when an airbag is observed to be deployed during a car crash,
                    it increases the odds of observing a fatality as well, hence airbag deployment is a fair indicator of the crash severity (<i>correlation not causation</i>).

                    <br><br>
                    It is important, however, to follow guidance on how to safely position yourself and your passengers,
                    as well as young ones in car seats and booster seats to prevent injury from air bags in a crash.

                    Generally, when there is a moderate to severe crash, a signal is sent from the air bag system's electronic control unit to inflate the air bag within the blink of an eye (less than 1/20th of a second). Because air bags deploy very rapidly, serious or sometimes fatal injuries can occur if the driver or passenger is too close to â€“ or comes in direct contact with â€“ the air bag when it first begins to deploy.
                    Side-impact air bags inflate even more quickly since there is less space between the driver or passengers and the striking object, whether the interior of the vehicle, another vehicle, a tree, or a pole.

<b>Satety tips:</b>
<div  class="my-list">
<ul>
  <li>
      Sitting as far back from the steering wheel or dashboard as possible and using seat belts help prevent drivers and passengers from being "too close" to a deploying frontal air bag. This is why rear-facing car seats should not be placed in front of an active air bag, and children under 13 should be seated in the back seat.
  </li>
  <li>
      Always buckle your seat belt. The seat belt is the single most effective vehicle safety technology. Air bags are supplemental protection and are designed to work best in combination with seat belts.
  </li>
