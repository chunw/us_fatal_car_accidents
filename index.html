            A motor vehicle crash results from a combination of factors related to the components of the system
            comprising roads, the environment, vehicles and road users, and the way they interact.

            Some factors contribute to the
            occurrence of a collision and are therefore part of
            crash causation. Other factors aggravate the
            effects of the collision and thus contribute to
            trauma severity. Some
            causes are immediate, but they may be
            underpinned by medium-term and long-term
            structural causes. Identifying the top risk factors that contribute to fatal motor vehicle crashes is important in developing
            interventions that can reduce the risks associated with those factors.

                            Fatal crashes mostly happen in rush hours with busy traffic caused by commuting, e.g. from <b>17:00 to 19:00</b>. Interestingly, they are also more frequent in winter seasons, e.g. <b>November and Decemeber</b>, which might be related to the terrible weather conditions (snow in the East and rain on the west).

                              Note that we do not observe the same high frequency during rush hours in the morning. We further explore the type/level of light that existed at the time of the crash. (Click on <span style="color:#e36e68">WITH BAD LIGHTING</span> tab to see more details.)

                    The culprit is one West Texas highway that is notorious for being dangerous -
                    Highway 285, which runs from New Mexico right on through the small town of Fort Stockton.

                    According to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, there were another three fatal crashes from the Texas state line to Loving in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourbasin.com/news/dangerous-drive-on-highway-285/862459415">2017</a>.

                    <strong>Methodology:</strong> This visualization relates the vehicle's travel speed at time of crash to the driver’s past speeding records.
                    The overspeeding amount is computed by substracting the road speed limit from the vehicle's travel speed at the time of crash. e.g. '20+' means the vehicle was traveling 20 MPH more than the speed limit.
                    Speeding record is represented by the number of previous speeding convictions for the driver that occurred within five years of the crash date, ranging from 0 to 7.

                  Overall, the green bars (“no speeding”) display a downward trend, i.e. drivers who kept a good record in the past tend to behave well all the time. Note that no-speeding ratio increases significantly when the number of previous speeding convictions rises to 6. This suggests that drivers who frequently made mistakes may receive either punishment or education so that they started to respect the speed rule. The red bars (“severe speeding”) first reach a peak and then decrease. This suggests that wild drivers are less likely to be deterred from defying the rule.

                  <li>
                    Keep alert at all times; don’t be distracted by electronic devices that take your eyes (and ears) off the road.

                  <li>
                    Whenever possible, cross streets at crosswalks or intersections, where drivers expect pedestrians. Look for cars in all directions, including those turning left or right.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a crosswalk or intersection is not available, locate a well-lit area where you have the best view of traffic. Wait for a gap in traffic that allows enough time to cross safely; continue watching for traffic as you cross.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Never assume a driver sees you. Make eye contact with drivers as they approach to make sure you are seen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be visible at all times. Wear bright clothing during the day, and wear reflective materials or use a flashlight at night.
                  </li>

                The improved quality of cars is a bit of a double-edged
                sword when it comes to the age issue.
                As cars get better on multiple fronts, such as
                safety technology and crashworthiness, they also
                become more reliable and longer lasting, leading to
                Americans driving cars until they're much older and
                pushing the average age of a car in the U.S. up to
                11.6 years at last count. Despite these gains in car quality,
                the older a car gets, the less reliable and less safe it becomes.

                    While we had expected lower fatality rate associated with airbags deployed,
                    on the surface the data seem to show otherwise. Our hypothesis for this pattern
                    is that both air bags are generally designed to deploy only in moderate to severe crashes,
                    so when the airbags are observed to be deployed, we can assume that the crash is
                    much more severe than when airbags are not deployed and is inherently much
                    more dangerous. Hence it's not a fair conclusion from this chart that airbags
                    are not effective. In fact, NHTSA estimated [3] that 2,756 lives were saved by frontal air bags in 2016. This visualization is not to show that airbags are useless in terms of protecting vehicle occupants safety. Rather, a fair conclusion is when an airbag is observed to be deployed during a car crash, it increases the odds of observing a fatality as well, hence airbag deployment can be used as an indicator of the crash severity (correlation not causation).


                    On the surface, it seems that the portion of fatal injuries are
                    higher in scenarios where the airbag is deployed than when it is not.
                    Keep in mind though, that frontal and side air bags
                    are generally designed to deploy in moderate to severe crashes
                    (may deploy in a minor crash).  -->

                    On the surface, the data deviates from our expectation that
                    airbags deployed are associated with lower fatality rate. Our hypothesis for this
                    pattern is that airbags are generally designed to deploy only in moderate
                    to severe crashes, therefore when the airbags are observed to be deployed,
                    we can assume that the crash is much more severe than when airbags
                    are not deployed. If factoring in crash severity,
                    airbags may have been effective in lowering the fatality risk
                    of vehicle occupants in severe crashes.
                    In fact, <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812494"
                    target="_blank"> NHTSA estimated </a> that 2,756 lives were saved by

                    It is important, however, to follow guidance on how to safely position yourself and your passengers,
                    as well as young ones in car seats and booster seats to prevent injury from air bags in a crash.

                    Generally, when there is a moderate to severe crash, a signal is sent from the air bag system's electronic control unit to inflate the air bag within the blink of an eye (less than 1/20th of a second). Because air bags deploy very rapidly, serious or sometimes fatal injuries can occur if the driver or passenger is too close to – or comes in direct contact with – the air bag when it first begins to deploy.
                    Side-impact air bags inflate even more quickly since there is less space between the driver or passengers and the striking object, whether the interior of the vehicle, another vehicle, a tree, or a pole.

                      Sit as far back from the steering wheel or dashboard as possible and using seat belts help prevent drivers and passengers from being "too close" to a deploying frontal air bag. This is why rear-facing car seats should not be placed in front of an active air bag, and children under 13 should be seated in the back seat.

                  <li>
                      Always buckle your seat belt. The seat belt is the single most effective vehicle safety technology. Air bags are supplemental protection and are designed to work best in combination with seat belts.

        From the above analysis, we have identified top risk factors that are correlated with fatality in car accidents. Some factors, such as speeding and alcohol or drug impaired driving, contribute to the occurrence of a collision and are therefore part of crash causation. Other factors, such as old vehicles and unused restraints systems, aggravate the effects of the collision and thus contribute to trauma severity.

        As there are a lot of variables involved in a car accident,
        when we correlate one factor to fatality risk, it is difficult to
        control other factors and completely rule out their influences.
        <br>  <br>
        To overcome this shortcoming, we have built a machine learning model, based on our analysis, for predicting
        a person's fatality risk in a road traffic crash scenario given input features
        about this person, such as alcohol usage, seating position, person type, etc. We encourage interested readers
        to play with <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yongqM1eD2E0vypQh0VRG0g9Nt6wHZJP#scrollTo=9NBitblc0E78">our model <img style="width: 15px; margin-right: 4px; margin-top: -2px; vertical-align: middle;" src="img/extern-link.svg"/></a>
        and see how much changing a factor while keeping other factors the same
        will increase or descrease fatality risk.

        <br>  <br>

        Due to the sheer volume of data present in the NHSTA dataset, our analysis is likely to
        have overlooked some other risk factors contributing to fatal car crashes.
