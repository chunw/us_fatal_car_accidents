          Motor vehicle travel is a major means of transportation in the United States, yet for all its advantages,
          motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for persons every age from 5 to 32 years old [1].
          A motor vehicle crash results from a combination of factors related to the components of the system
          comprising roads, the environment, vehicles and road users, and the way they interact.

          Identifying the top risk factors that contribute to fatal motor vehicle crashes is important in developing
          interventions that can reduce the risks associated with those factors.
          We deep dived into the fatal car crash records in the U.S. in year 2016, collected by National Highway
          Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) [2] and encoded using the
          <a target="_blank" class="tooltipped" data-position="right" data-tooltip="<div class='custom-tooltip'>Fatality Analysis Reporting System is a nationwide census providing <br> NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), Congress <br> and the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered <br> in motor vehicle traffic crashes.<br><br>Click the link to view how data are encoded using the FARS system.</div>"

            A road traffic crash results from a
            combination of factors related to the
            components of the system comprising roads, the
            environment, vehicles and road users, and the
            way they interact. Some factors contribute to the
            occurrence of a collision and are therefore part of
            crash causation. Other factors aggravate the
            effects of the collision and thus contribute to
            trauma severity. Some
            causes are immediate, but they may be
            underpinned by medium-term and long-term
            structural causes.

            <br>
            As we explore how different variables correlate with fatality risk of a person,
            and it is important to look at how fatality risk should be defined, based on the data available.

                    Fatal crashes mostly happen in rush hours with busy traffic caused by commuting, e.g. from <b>17:00 to 19:00</b>.

                    The culprit is one West Texas Highway that is notorious for being dangerous -
                    Highway 285, which runs from New Mexico right on through the small town of Fort Stockton.

                    According to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, there were another three fatal crashes from the Texas state line to Loving in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourbasin.com/news/dangerous-drive-on-highway-285/862459415">2017</a>.

                    <strong>Methodology:</strong> The data relates the vehicle speed to the driver’s speeding record. Vehicle speed is compared against the speed limit. e.g. '20+' means the vehicle was traveling 20 MPH more than the speed limit. Speeding record is represented by the number of previous speeding convictions for the driver that occurred within five years of the crash date, ranging from 0 to 7.

                  Overall, the green bars (“no speeding”) display a downward trend, i.e. drivers who kept a good record in the past tend to behave well all the time. Note that no-speeding ratio increases significantly when the number of previous speeding convictions rises to 6. This suggests that drivers who frequently made mistakes may receive either punishment or education so that they started to respect the speed rule. The red bars (“severe speeding”) first reach a peak and then decrease. This suggests that wild drivers are less likely to be deterred from defying the rule.

                    Ejection from the vehicle is one of the most injurious events that can happen to a person in a crash. Seat belts are very effective in preventing total ejections; in 2016 only 1 percent of all passenger vehicle occupants (those killed as well as survivors) in fatal crashes reported to have been using restraints were totally ejected, compared to 29% of those unrestrained.

                  <div class="">
                    On the surface, it seems that the portion of fatal injuries are
                    higher in scenarios where the airbag is deployed than when it is not.
                    Keep in mind though, that frontal and side air bags
                    are generally designed to deploy in moderate to severe crashes
                    (may deploy in a minor crash). In fact, <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812494" target="_blank"> NHTSA estimated </a> that 2,756 lives were saved by frontal air bags in 2016.
                    This visualization is not to show that airbags are useless in terms of protecting vehicle occupants safety, as it can be
                    assumed that the crash severity level
                    on average is higher when airbags are deployed than when they are not.

                    Rather, a fair conclusion is when an airbag is observed to be deployed during a car crash,
                    it increases the odds of observing a fatality as well, hence airbag deployment is a fair indicator of the crash severity (<i>correlation not causation</i>).

                    <br><br>
                    It is important, however, to follow guidance on how to safely position yourself and your passengers,
                    as well as young ones in car seats and booster seats to prevent injury from air bags in a crash.

                    Generally, when there is a moderate to severe crash, a signal is sent from the air bag system's electronic control unit to inflate the air bag within the blink of an eye (less than 1/20th of a second). Because air bags deploy very rapidly, serious or sometimes fatal injuries can occur if the driver or passenger is too close to – or comes in direct contact with – the air bag when it first begins to deploy.
                    Side-impact air bags inflate even more quickly since there is less space between the driver or passengers and the striking object, whether the interior of the vehicle, another vehicle, a tree, or a pole.

                      Sitting as far back from the steering wheel or dashboard as possible and using seat belts help prevent drivers and passengers from being "too close" to a deploying frontal air bag. This is why rear-facing car seats should not be placed in front of an active air bag, and children under 13 should be seated in the back seat.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Always buckle your seat belt. The seat belt is the single most effective vehicle safety technology. Air bags are supplemental protection and are designed to work best in combination with seat belts.

This may be related to the (small) sizes of state area and population.
